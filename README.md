<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Board Together is a board game platform that allows users to create their own profiles and list their favorite board games. It utilizes a React FrontEnd and GraphQL & PostgreSQL Backend to create a seamless user experience and features API calls to the popular Board Game Atlas API to provide up-to-date information about various board games. With this platform, board game enthusiasts can keep track of their collection, discover new games to play, and connect with others to share the games they have collected. The platform is easy to use and accessible to anyone who loves board games or wants to learn more about them.

<!-- Deployment Information -->
### Deployment Information

Board Together is a full-stack application combining a React frontend deployed to Surge and Ruby on Rails backend deployed to Heroku. The frontend handles client-side tasks and displays data from the backend, which handles server-side logic and database operations. Deployment involves building the React frontend, integrating it with the Rails backend, and pushing the code to Heroku. The application can be accessed at the Heroku URL.

<!-- Available Endpoints -->
## Available GraphQL Endpoints

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/25666683-0ebb6dbb-8b11-460e-8585-8adaf17a4211?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D25666683-0ebb6dbb-8b11-460e-8585-8adaf17a4211%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D744a08a3-dcad-44e1-bb68-becc0c7dbc17)

Endpoints are run through GraphQL queries. Expand a section below for query requests and expected responses.

You build roads and new settlements that eventually become cities. Will you succeed in gaining supremacy on Catan? Barter trade dominates the scene. Some resources you have in abundance, other resources are scarce. Ore for wool, brick for lumber - you trade according to what is needed for your current building projects. Proceed strategically! If you found your settlements in the right places and skillfully trade your resources, then the odds will be in your favor. But your opponents are smart too.</p>\r\n<p>To begin the game, we build the game board using hexagonal terrain tiles. Catan is born - a beautiful island with mountains, pastures, hills, fields, and forests, surrounded by the sea.</p>\r\n<p>Each of us places two small houses on spaces where three terrain hexes meet. They are our starting settlements.</p>\r\n<p>And so it begins. I roll two dice. An “11”! Each terrain hex is marked with a die roll number. Each player who owns a settlement adjacent to a terrain hex marked with the number rolled receives a resource produced by this hex. Hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool.</p>\r\n<p>We use these resources to expand across Catan: we build roads and new settlements, or we upgrade our existing settlements to cities. For example, a road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber. If we do not have the necessary resources, we can acquire them by trading with our opponents.</p>\r\n<p>Each settlement is worth 1 victory point and each city is worth 2 victory points. If you expand cleverly, you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game!</p>",

Field your knights!<br /><br /> In <b>Catan: Cities &amp; Knights</b> you engage in the defense of Catan and compete to build the three great metropolises of Catan. Each of these magnificent urban centers is even more valuable than a city. They’re also immune to the dangerous barbarians. Invest in city improvements, which you acquire using three commodities of trade: coin, paper, and cloth.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

MVP

* CRUD functionality for User and UserGames.
* Search for a board game utilizing [Board Game Atlas API](https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/docs/search).
* Add board games to User collection.
* Track board games you have borrowed and board games you have lent out.

Stretch Goals

* Add friends feature, allowing a User to add friends and see that friend's games instead of all User's games.
* Implement User authentication using a OAuth provider.
* Create board game parties, where friends can arrange get togethers to play a certain game.
* Ability to add comments or reviews to games you have, or have borrowed.
* Email notifications for requests to borrow games.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/board-together/FE-Board-Together/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
