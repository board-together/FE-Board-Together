## About The Project

![Product Demo](lib/assets/demo.gif)

Board Together is a board game platform that allows users to create their own profiles and list their favorite board games. It utilizes GraphQL and PostgreSQL to create a seamless user experience and features API calls to the popular Board Game Atlas API to provide up-to-date information about various board games. With this platform, board game enthusiasts can keep track of their collection, discover new games to play, and connect with others who share their interests. The platform is easy to use and accessible to anyone who loves board games or wants to learn more about them.
