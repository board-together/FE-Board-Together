So climb aboard for some railroading fun and adventure. You've got a Ticket to Ride!<br /><br />October 2, 1900 -- it's 28 years to the day that noted London eccentric, Phileas Fogg accepted and then won a 20,000 bet that he could travel Around the World in 80 Days. Now at the dawn of the century some old friends have gathered to celebrate Fogg's impetuous and lucrative gamble -- and to propose a new wager of their own. The stakes: $1 million in a winner-takes-all competition. The objective: to see the most cities in North America -- in just 7 days. <br /><br />-Spiel Des Jahres 2004(German game of the year)<br />-As d'Or Cannes 2004 (French game of the year)<br />-Game of the year 2004 - Japan<br />-Game of the year 2004 - Sweden<br />-Game of the year 2004 - Finland<br />-Diana Jones Excellence in Gaming Award 2004<br />-Origins Award Winner - Best Board Game 2005<br />-Game of the year 2004 - Spain<br />-Parent's Choice Foundation Silver Medal 2004</p>",

There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory. A clever action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short yet tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, it keeps you focused on smart time-management.</p>",
